/**
 * A promise-shaped way for one component to ask the user something in a dialog:
 * `ask` shows what `render` draws and settles with the value the dialog hands to
 * `resolve`. One dialog is open at a time.
 *
 * Every question ends. Unlike Big Picture's `showModal`, whose dismissal never
 * resolves, each `ask` names its `dismissed` answer up front, and the host
 * settles with it when a newer question replaces this one or the component
 * unmounts — so a flow awaiting a dialog on a page the user has left runs to its
 * cancel exit instead of waiting forever.
